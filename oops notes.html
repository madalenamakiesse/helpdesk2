        <h4> Q1:- Define Class function in oops?</h4> 
        
        <h5>In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects (instances). It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects created from the class will have.<br><br>

            A class can contain various elements, including:<br><br>
            
            1. **Attributes**: These are variables that store data or state information about the objects created from the class. Attributes are sometimes referred to as member variables or instance variables.<br>
            
            2. **Methods**: These are functions or procedures that define the behavior or actions that objects of the class can perform. Methods are sometimes called member functions.<br>
            
            A class is like a blueprint for creating objects, and objects are instances of that class. You can think of a class as a user-defined data type that encapsulates both data (attributes) and the functions (methods) that operate on that data.<br><br>
            
            Here's a simple example in Python to illustrate a class:<br><br>
            
            Classes are fundamental to OOP as they allow you to model real-world entities with their characteristics and behaviors, making code more organized, reusable, and easier to maintain.</h5>
        <br><br><br>

        <h4> Q2:- Define the term Function in OOPS ?</h4> 
       
        <h5>In object-oriented programming (OOP), a function is a block of code that defines a specific behavior or action that can be performed by objects of a class. Functions in OOP are also referred to as methods. These methods are associated with classes and operate on the data and attributes of objects created from those classes.<br><br>

            Here are some key points about functions (methods) in OOPS:<br><br>
            
            1. **Member Functions/Methods**: Functions defined within a class are often called methods or member functions. These methods are used to define the behavior of objects created from the class.<br><br>
            
            2. **Access to Class Data**: Methods have access to the class's attributes (data members) and can manipulate them as needed. This allows you to encapsulate data and behavior within a class, promoting data hiding and abstraction.<br><br>
            
            3. **Instance Methods**: Most methods in OOP are instance methods, which means they operate on specific instances or objects of the class. They typically take the instance itself (`self` in Python) as the first parameter to access instance-specific data.<br><br>
            
            4. **Encapsulation**: Methods help in encapsulating data and behavior together within a class. This encapsulation is one of the fundamental principles of OOP, and it helps in managing the complexity of large software systems.<br><br>
            
            Here's an example in Python that demonstrates a class with methods:<br><br>
            
            Functions (methods) in OOP help you define the behavior of objects and enable you to work with instances of classes, making it a powerful paradigm for organizing and structuring code.</h5>
        <br><br><br>

        <h4> Q3:- Define the term of Object in OOPS?</h4> 
        
        <h5>In object-oriented programming (OOP), an object is a fundamental concept that represents a real-world entity or concept as an instance of a class. An object is a self-contained unit that combines both data (attributes or properties) and behaviors (methods or functions) that operate on that data. Objects are created based on the blueprint or template defined by a class.<br><br>

            Here are some key characteristics and points about objects in OOP:<br><br>
            
            1. **Instance of a Class**: An object is essentially an instance of a class. A class defines the structure (attributes) and behavior (methods) that its objects will have.<br><br>
            
            2. **Attributes (Properties)**: Objects have attributes that store data or state specific to that object. These attributes are sometimes called member variables or instance variables.<br>
            
            3. **Methods (Functions)**: Objects have methods that define the actions or behaviors that can be performed by that object. These methods are sometimes called member functions.<br>
            
            4. **Encapsulation**: Objects encapsulate both data and behavior within a single unit. This helps in organizing and managing complex systems by grouping related data and functions together.<br><br>
            
            5. **Identity**: Each object has a unique identity, allowing it to be distinguished from other objects of the same class.<br><br>
            
            6. **State**: An object's state refers to the current values of its attributes. These values can change over time as methods are called.<br><br>
            
            7. **Behavior**: An object's behavior refers to the actions it can perform through its methods. The behavior of an object is determined by the class it belongs to.<br><br>
            
            Here's a simple example in Python to illustrate the concept of objects:<br><br>
            
            
            
            Objects are a central concept in OOP and provide a way to model and work with complex systems by organizing data and behavior into reusable and self-contained units.</h5>
